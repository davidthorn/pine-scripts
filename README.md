# Trading View Pine Scripts

Dear fellow traders,

Welcome to the home of DJThorn Trading Indicators on GitHub!

This repository has been established with the aim of providing an open and unrestricted platform for sharing Pine scripts for TradingView. As a passionate trader and developer, I believe in the power of open source and the importance of community collaboration in enhancing trading strategies.

The inspiration behind creating this repository stems from the need to counteract the increasing regulation of scripts within the TradingView community. While moderators may impose rules and restrictions on certain scripts, I firmly believe that the true value of a script should be determined by the community itself.

Here, you will find a collection of Pine scripts developed by me, David James Thorn, aimed at assisting traders in their technical analysis and strategy development. From simple indicators to complex trading algorithms, the scripts featured in this repository are freely available for exploration, experimentation, and utilization. (Currently only one at the moment! But more will come)

It's worth mentioning that the philosophy of this repository is simple: open source, no rules. Scripts are not judged or regulated by arbitrary house rules but rather evaluated based on their practical utility and value to traders. Your feedback, comments, and contributions are highly encouraged and welcomed.

I invite you to explore the scripts (1), experiment with them in your TradingView setups, and contribute to the repository by submitting pull requests with your own enhancements, fixes, or new scripts. Additionally, don't forget to show your support by starring the repository, helping to increase its visibility and reach within the trading community.

Let's collaborate, innovate, and empower each other to become better traders together.

Happy trading!

David James Thorn
